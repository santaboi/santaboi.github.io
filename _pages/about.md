<!-- (Sample introduction) Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.) -->

I work as a research assistant for Computer Vision, advised by Prof. [Chih-Chung Hsu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mIWRYc4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests mainly lies in Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. Currently, I've been focusing on Generative AI for image manipulation and the mitigation of misinfomation generated by AI. 

I earn my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from NCKU in 2024 . During Bachelor's degree, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Lun-Wei Ku](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SzcLXlkAAAAJ&hl=en) at Acadamia Sinica, and Prof. [Hsun-Ping Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f6SBzrAAAAAJ&hl=en) at, NCKU.

Recently, I am actively pursuing Master's degree and focus on research topics.
