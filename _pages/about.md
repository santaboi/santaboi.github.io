I am a first-year M.S. student in computer science at University of Maryland College Park.
My research interests mainly lies in AI safety and how to make AI reliable, trustable,and with good social impact. Currently, I've been focusing on generative AI for image manipulation and the mitigation of misinfomation generated by AI. 

I did my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Cheng Kung University in 2024 . During Bachelor's degree, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Lun-Wei Ku](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SzcLXlkAAAAJ&hl=en) at Acadamia Sinica, Prof. [Chih-Chung Hsu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mIWRYc4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Hsun-Ping Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f6SBzrAAAAAJ&hl=en) at, NCKU.

ðŸ“¢ Currently, I am finding prospective research opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if there is any suitable position!!
