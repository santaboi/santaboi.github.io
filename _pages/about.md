I work as a research assistant for Computer Vision, advised by Prof. [Chih-Chung Hsu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mIWRYc4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests mainly lies in Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. Currently, I've been focusing on Generative AI for image manipulation and the mitigation of misinfomation generated by AI. 

I earn my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from NCKU in 2024 . During Bachelor's degree, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Lun-Wei Ku](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SzcLXlkAAAAJ&hl=en) at Acadamia Sinica, and Prof. [Hsun-Ping Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f6SBzrAAAAAJ&hl=en) at, NCKU.
